		Accommodation
		</h1>
<p>
The University has several halls of residence split between three different areas; City, Victoria Park and Fallowfield. 

<p><strong>City</strong><p>
Halls are located on and around the university campus meaning travelling to your classes takes little time. They are usually recommended to work focussed students as the social opportunities may be lacking compared to others. Has prices between £115 and £218 per week with the options of ensuite bathrooms. There are no catered accommodations here but as a student, it is recommended to cook for yourself as it tends to be cheaper and you have more control over when and what you eat. Ensuite facilities are an enjoyable luxury however so if you can afford to stay in a hall with one I would recommend it but it also won’t ruin your experience if you don’t.

<p><strong>Victoria Park</strong><p>
Situated between the City and Fallowfield areas, these halls are ideally placed for both academic and social activities. It is a 15-minute walk from campus but also provides regular bus services so you can get to wherever you need. Next to Victoria Park is the famous Curry mile full of many restaurants and shops. Whitworth Park and the Whitworth art gallery are also nearby mixed into leafy green surroundings providing a pleasant atmosphere to live in if that’s your thing.
<p>
Halls here are priced between £160 and £173 with options for catering and ensuite bathrooms. 


<p><strong>Fallowfield</strong><p>
These halls are furthest away from campus but boast the best social scene at Manchester so if you enjoy nights out then this may be the place for you. There is a great mix of shops, cafes, and bars with frequent bus services to the city centre making it an ideal place to live. 


<p>
The halls are priced between £110 and £170 including the famous oak house which is the cheapest university accommodation in Manchester. There are options to choose meal catering as well as ensuite bathrooms.
