		The City of Manchester
		</h1>
<p>
Manchester is a city in the North West of England, it is the second largest city by population in England and is generally thought of as the capital of the North. It was established by the Romans in 79 AD with a fort named Mancunium and remained a relatively small town until it rapidly expanded with the industrial revolution becoming the first industrialised city and earning the nickname “cottonopolis”, it became a city in 1853.

<p>
The city is notable for its architecture, culture, musical exports, media links, scientific and engineering output, social impact, sports clubs, and transport connections. Liverpool road railway station was the worlds first inter-city passenger railway station. At the University of Manchester, Ernest Rutherford split the atom in 1917, Frederic Williams, Tom Kilburn and Geoff Tootill developed the worlds first stored program-computer in 1948, and Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov isolated the first graphene in 2004.

<h1>Social Life</h1>
<p>
There is loads to do in Manchester. A list of some of the places that students often find themselves at can be found <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?msa=0&ll=53.46269792924842%2C-2.216957221587683&spn=0.0034%2C0.009162&mid=1hf_-15VbUp93qQCRl6aUFLVPcgg&z=14">here</a>.
<p>
<h1>Gym</h1>
<p>
There are several gyms around Manchester with locations no matter where you choose to live. 
<p>
If you are going to live near campus, there are several options to choose from. Located near northern campus is JD gym which costs £19.99 per month and occasionally offers student discounts, it has saunas which others lack. In the city centre there are The Gym Group and PureGym gyms which are both open 24 hours and both have permanent student discounts. The Gym offers 12 months for £159 (£13.25/month) and PureGym offers 6/9/12 months from £18.67/£17.55/£15.33 per month or £14.99 per month for an off peak no contract membership. 
<p>
These chain gyms will be of similar quality, so I recommend whichever is cheaper and most convenient for you. I chose The Gym Group as they offered 9 months (school year) for a discount when I signed up at the start of term and the hours allow me to go when it is suitable for me.
<p>
There is also Sugden sports centre on campus which is owned by the university (Joint with MMU) offering 9 months for £130 (£14.44/month) but is not 24 hours.

<p>
There are multiple private gyms in the city centre however I would not recommend these as they are usually so not student friendly price wise however you may prefer these if you have a large budget and want a more premium experience.

<p>
If you live near Victoria Park or Fallowfield you can choose between The Gym Group (£159 for 12 months) or The Armitage Sports Centre which is also owned by the university, it offers 9 months for £96 (£10.67/month) to students and £70 (£7.78/month)  for an academic year for Halls of residence members but is not open 24 hours and all gym sessions must be booked in advance. You may prefer to go to the gym when you travel to campus if these options are too far away from your accommodation.

<p>
The vast majority of these gyms will offer personal training however it is usually very expensive just for information you can find online if you do proper research and is therefore not recommended.
