Why go to university?		</h1>
<p>
University is an amazing opportunity to learn more about the subject that you enjoy the most. Expanding on your knowledge from school and sixth form and realising that you have only scratched the surface of the subject is incredibly satisfying and it’s intriguing to continue to learn more about your subject. 		
<p>

If you do well in your first year at University, there is an option called a year in industry on a lot of courses. For Computer Science, a year in industry can be an amazing chance to work at huge companies like Google, IBM, Facebook, and more without having to go through the normal rigorous hiring process. Even if you do not get a top company, any experience will look good on a CV. Additionally, if you do well in your year with a company, they may offer you a job regardless of what grade you get in your final year.
<p>
A degree offers you many opportunities that you may not have had without going to university. Unfortunately, many jobs won’t consider people that don’t have a degree, so getting a degree can be very useful to getting hired. Universities also tend to have access to jobs for graduates that you will be able to take advantage of, instead of having to go through hundreds of jobs on Indeed etc.

<p>
University is also great for meeting new people. University is one of the few times in your adult life that you would have the opportunity to live within a few miles of all of your friends, and as a result the social life is astounding compared to working a job.
<p>
There are ample opportunities for you to find people that you have things in common with, from societies, your course, your flatmates if you’re living in accommodation, and more. The University puts on lots of subsidised events for its students which mean that even with a relatively small cost of living, you can still have an active social life.

<p>
You do however have to make sure you care about your subject. If the only reason you’re applying for a particular subject is because there is a high paying job at the end of it, it’s important to realise that if you don’t enjoy the subject then you probably won’t enjoy the job, no matter how high the pay is. Before getting into debt that most will likely never pay off, it may be worth taking time out for a few years, working a job, and seeing what you are passionate about. 
<p>
There are plenty of options other than University, including degree apprenticeships for some courses. Degree apprenticeships allow you to get a degree whilst also getting paid. It is useful to take some time to think about the subject that you are taking, and the cost of the degree before committing.
